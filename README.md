# Pattern Problems - Take U Forward (Striver's AtoZ Sheet)

This repository contains my solutions for 22 different pattern problems, as part of my journey through the "Take U Forward" Striver's AtoZ sheet. Each pattern is implemented in Java, with an aim to improve my understanding of nested loops, space complexity, and logic building.

## Patterns Included
The following patterns have been implemented:

1. **Alpha Hill**
2. **Alpha-Ramp**
3. **Alpha-Triangle**
4. **Binary Number Triangle**
5. **Both triangle and reverse triangle pattern**
6. **Increasing Letter Triangle**
7. **Increasing Number Triangle**
8. **Ninja And The Number Pattern**
9. **Ninja And The Star Pattern I**
10. **Number Crown**
11. **Reverse Letter Triangle**
12. **Symmetric Void**
13. **left lower+left upper triangle**
14. **left number pattern**
15. **left pattern**
16. **left repeat pattern**
17. **rectangle pattern**
18. **reverse left number pattern**
19. **reverse left patteren**
20. **reverse triangle pattern**
21. **symmetry**
22. **triangle pattern**

## Technologies Used
- **Language**: Java

## Structure of the Repository
- Each pattern problem has a dedicated Java file in this repository.
- The file names and the respective pattern descriptions are provided for easy reference.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository-name.git
2.Navigate to the folder and open the Java files in your IDE.

3.Run the Java programs to see the patterns printed in the console.

## Why Pattern Problems?
Pattern problems are an excellent way to get comfortable with loops and conditionals. They help in building the logic required for complex programming concepts. This journey through 22 patterns has strengthened my basics and prepared me for more advanced problems.
